# Hello, world! 👋

I'm the founder of **WikiDev LLC**, a company dedicated to making the world of software development more accessible and efficient. With a passion for coding and a love for democracy, I started WikiDev LLC with the goal of creating a platform where developers at all levels can come together to learn, share, and grow.

## About Me

- 🌱 As the founder of WikiDev LLC, I'm constantly learning and adapting to help my team and the project succeed. My current focus is on improving our user experience and expanding our toolset.
- 👯 I'm always open to collaboration, especially on open source projects that align with WikiDev's mission of making software development more accessible.
- ⚡ When I'm not coding or managing WikiDev, I love to play chess and go hiking. I find both activities help me relax and stimulate my mind in different ways.
